1. Design a strategy to solve your partial-feedback multi-armed bandit problem with stochastic and non-stochastic algorithms like using UCB1, EXP3, Thompson and MWU.
2. Design a strategy to solve your full-feedback multi-armed bandit problem with stochastic and non-stochastic algorithms like UCB1, Thompson and MWU algorithms.
3. Analyze how the recommendation probabilities for movies changes over time. For our analysis, we will focus on top 10 highly rated movies by devising any metric to pick these movies. After making the movie selection, plot the recommendation probabilitie.
